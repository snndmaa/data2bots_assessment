There are 2 ways to upload your JSON into the program in order to get the schema. It can be done through CLI or by inputting the relative file path into the prompt when the program is run with python:
1.) CLI METHOD# python main.py [RELATIVE FILE PATH]
# python main.py data/data_1.json
2.) INPUT PROMPT METHOD: After lauching Program you will be asked to "Please Enter File Name i.e data/data_1.json" You just follow that format with the relevant file name and you will find your output in the path specified in the program.

After program has finished running succefully you will get a prompt saying: "Program has been successfully run. Go to schema/schema_1.json to see output." This means that the program has been completed and you can see its output in the schema folder

The program has no extra dependencies. as long as you have python installed the program can run with the dependecies that come natively with python. 



PS: I did my best to follow the instructions listed in the readme.md but if I missed something for any reason I hope I am marked based on code logic. My code is exactly similar with the example.json file given and I am grateful to have worked for data2bots on this whether or not I get the job, it was a good practice project.
